Binomial Classification using LogisticRegression, based on Winsconsin data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

**Summary:** The most accurate model were the one trained with scaled data (using stdScaler), it was compared with the data unscaled and scaled using minmaxScaler.
The metrics obtained with the Logistic Regression model were: 
  - F1 of 0.986,
  - Precision of 0.969,
  - Accuracy of '.982,
  - False-positive: 2 and False-negative: 1 (classification errors).
